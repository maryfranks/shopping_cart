Dreaded capitalism!

Your program should have two separate classes: one to represent a product to be
purchased and one to represent a shopping cart containing a collection of products.

Each product has a name, base price, and tax rate. There should also be a method
to calculate and return the product's total price based on the base price and
tax rate.

Each shopping cart has a collection of products. It should also have the
following functionality:

  * add an product to the cart
  * remove an product from the cart
  * add up the total cost of all products in the cart before tax
  * add up the total cost of all products in the cart after tax
  * Think about which class needs to make reference to the other one and remember
    to use a require statement accordingly. You don't need it in both files.

========== Stretch goals ============

-Add the ability to find the most expensive product in a cart.
-Allow a quantity to be associated with each product in the cart. What is the
  best way to store this information? How does it affect each of your other
  methods?
-Instead of storing the tax rate for each product, come up with a tax classification
  system (eg. standard, tax exempt, imported) so the rates are standardized across
  all products.
